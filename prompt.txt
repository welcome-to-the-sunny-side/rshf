we are going to be working with @frontend right now

earlier, when the backend wasn't functional, several pages were populated with dummy data instead of stuff actually fetched from the backend through the api

the api reference docs can be found here: @api_reference.md 


right now:
1. the backend and auth are done
2. the replacement in @Group.jsx has been completed 

the replacement in @GroupMembers.jsx has only partially been done

please remove all dummy data use from @GroupMembers.jsx and use the appropriate api functions to get real data

(note: you should ignore report accuracy for now, as it hasn't been implemented in the backend)

don't implement anything, discuss your plan with me first
